Welcome to Spring Theory, a captivating Unity-made 2D platformer game that will take you on a thrilling adventure as a nimble ninja frog. Put on your virtual ninja gear and prepare to embark on a high-flying journey through challenging obstacles and formidable enemies.

Spring Theory is the hard work of four CSSE students from University of Washington, Bothell, launched on June 1, 2023. We wanted to create a fun fast-paced platformer to match the theme of “spring,” so we brainstormed and ended up creating this game. We all hope you have fun playing this first version of our game! Spring Theory is a playable web game, and rated “E for Everyone!”
